CMS and Mobile App Maker. Shovel apps is a web software that lets you create awesome mobile applications for Android, iOS and Windows Phone, with different designs for each platform with the web technologies that you love: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The whole platform and extensions are developed using Node.JS (JavaScript) and Web Components. Hybrid mobile apps feel like native ones, but are easier to maintain and scale. You have full access to native functionality using generic JavaScript methods (Camera, SD Card, microphone, contacts, etc.).
